# Food Sharing App

Welcome to the Food Sharing App repository! This project is a web application built with React and Next.js, allowing users to discover and share their favorite food recipes. Currently, I am in the process of learning Next.js, a powerful framework that enhances React applications with server-side rendering and other performance optimizations. This project serves as a practical exercise to apply and reinforce my understanding of Next.js concepts such as routing, server-side rendering, and API integration.





## Tech Stack

**React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**Nextjs:** A React framework for server-rendered applications with improved SEO and performance.

**CSS Modules:** Scoped CSS for component styling.
